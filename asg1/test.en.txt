English:

    O for a muse of fire, that would ascend The brightest
heaven of invention, A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!

    Then should the warlike Harry, like himself, Assume the
port of Mars; and at his heels, Leashed in like hounds, should
famine, sword, and fire, Crouch for employment.

    Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to
bury Caesar, not to praise him.  The evil that men do lives
after them; The good is oft interred with their bones; So let
it be with Caesar.

    To be, or not to be, that is the question:  Whether it
is nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them.
